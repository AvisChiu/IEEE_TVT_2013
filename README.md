Motivation
---
* Because the vehicles can act as hotspots nowadays, people spend increasingly more time in vehicles like cars, subways or trains. 
* Since the WLAN capacity is shared by multiple vehicular users and session-oriented applications (e.g., VoIP) are sensitive to disconnection/disruption due to handover, a well-defined CAC algorithm should be devised to satisfy QoS requirements in hotspots. 
* This paper put forward CAC algorithm, to increase the channel utilization.
